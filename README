Dart implementation of BLAKE2 cryptographic hash function.

(Currently implements BLAKE2s variant.)

Supports variable length digests, keying, salt, personalization, and tree
mode; see constructor declaration.

EXAMPLE

	import 'dart:utf';
	import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';
	import 'package:blake2/blake2.dart';

	var h = new BLAKE2s();
	h.add(encodeUtf8("I want to hash this string"));
	var digest = h.close();
	print(CryptoUtils.bytesToHex(digest));

TODO

	- documentation
	- BLAKE2b
	- tests for tree mode
	- publication on pub.dartlang.org.
